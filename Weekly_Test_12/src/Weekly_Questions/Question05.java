5. Threading Coding â€“ Concurrent Number Printing:
Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of threads. The program should:

Create two threads.

The first thread prints numbers from 1 to 5.

The second thread prints numbers from 6 to 10.

Ensure that the numbers from both threads are printed concurrently.
